## Comparative Study
One difference noticed across Unity, Unreal and Godot while importing Kenney Assets is
where and what happened to the files. Unity imported the whole assets folder. With unreal I had
to pick and choose, or sometimes it would end up wonky. It was being strange about the texture,
and I had to import it separately in it’s own folder or the material stayed grey. Godot was easy to
import. Probably the cleanest of all of them, it just became its own folder in the scene. One
similarity in building the level was how the parent-child relationship worked. It was pretty much
the same. I just needed to drag and drop what I wanted to be the child on the parent asset in the
outliner/scene/hierarchy.

Prefab, Blueprint Actors vs packed scenes. Blueprints felt like the most work; packed
scenes and prefabs were easier, but a packed scene is more effort than a prefab. Once set up,
they were all easy enough to drag and drop into the scene to place them where you wanted.

I think if I had to choose one engine again, it would be Unity. Godot's terminology is still
a bit confusing to me. I don’t like how the word “scene” is used. Navigating is so much different
than Unity or Unreal. Unreal is somewhat of a pain. Creating blueprints is harder than packed
scene or prefabs. I would chose Unity because I’m familiar with it and its formatting is less
confusing than Gadot to me, without being as complex as Unreal. Not that complexity is bad, I
just didn’t need all that for this assignment.
